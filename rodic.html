        <h3>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London since 2006. Having worked within the oldest
          areas of London, we have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed and situated
          within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed
          Building Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed by aristocratic families (examples being
          Grosvenor, Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own large swathes of, what
          is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central London. These Great Estates maintain significant influence
          either through direct ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate
          Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the
          use, development, and appearance of the designated area.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and elsewhere the UK. Through sensitive,
          contextual design and iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have established a track
          record of obtaining difficult planning consents for both new-build and existing properties.

        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
          We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and interiors studio with the belief that
          buildings are more than brick and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our environment. Our practice
          specializes in design-led and highly crafted renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an ability to
          deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst safeguarding our clients’ commercial interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are and RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central London. Whilst much of our work is local to us
          in London, the practice has an expanding portfolio of work across the UK; predominantly in the east and
          southeast of England but also including projects reaching as far as Scotland. We have experience working in
          rural locations, particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Sussex where we have undertaken a number of
          farmstead and country house projects, for both UK and overseas-based clients. These projects often involve
          sensitive restoration of listed buildings, usually with some more contemporary new-build additions. The
          practice seeks to develop sensitive yet ambitious design solutions that celebrate heritage while recognizing
          that buildings are often now required to perform different functions and should consume less carbon in doing
          so. In striving for lower carbon design solutions, we look to insulate well and integrate renewable
          technologies wherever possible.
